# Demo

![Demo](http://g.recordit.co/UGeRPvWx3C.gif)

#Install

### Dependencies

* [Foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman)
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
* Node.js
* NPM
* an IRC Server ([Slack](https://slack.com/) or [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/) for example)
* A dedicated user to work as a Bot.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/PrudioHQ/prudio-irc.git
$ npm install
$ grunt build
```
Change your `.env` file with your own IRC configuration.
To start your local server use:

```
$ foreman start
```

Open your browser at [localhost:5000/client-html](http://localhost:5000/client-html).

# Using it with Slack

Firstly **create a new user** in your Slack team. Call it "*Bot*" or "*Support*" (it doesn't really matter).

With your Slack administrator account go to [settings](https://my.slack.com/admin/settings#change_gateways) and enable IRC gateway (SSL only).

Now with your "*Bot*" account go to the [gateways](https://my.slack.com/account/gateways) copy the data and fill it in your `.env` file.

Your `INVITE_USER` should be the nickname of the user you want to be automatically added to the channel (probably your own Slack nickname?).

# Using it with Hipchat

Comming soon.

# Deploying

Comming soon.

  		// OPTIONAL
      	window._PrudioSettings = {
        	title: 'Prudio Support',
        	/*
        	name: 'John',
        	email: 'john@prud.io',
        	buttonSelector: '#merda',
        	buttonColor: 'green',
        	*/
      	};
	</script>
	<!-- PRUDIO /END -->
</html>
```

# Issues

Please use the GitHub issues.

# Know issues

### Stoping foreman

When doing `CTRL + C` in Foreman the Node.js process does not exit.

This happens because of Socket.io opens a persistent connection to the server and Foreman cannot exit. Try doing `killall node`.
